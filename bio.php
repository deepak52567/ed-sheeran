            Edward Christopher Sheeran, MBE (born 17 February 1991) is an English
            singer, songwriter, guitarist, and record producer. Sheeran was born
            in Halifax, West Yorkshire, and raised in Framlingham, Suffolk. He
            attended the Academy of Contemporary Music in Guildford as an
            undergraduate from the age of 18 in 2009. In early 2011, Sheeran independently
            released the extended play, No. 5 Collaborations Project. After signing
             with Asylum Records, his debut album, + (read as "plus"), was released
             on 9 September 2011 and has since been certified seven-times platinum
             in the UK. The album contains the single "The A Team", which earned
             him the Ivor Novello Award for Best Song Musically and Lyrically.
             In 2012, Sheeran won the Brit Awards for Best British Male Solo Artist
              and British Breakthrough Act.
